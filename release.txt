Release Notes for mxflib version 0.2.1-Alpha
============================================

This version adds index table support.
Currently the index table loading is inefficient, but lookup is fast.
It also fixes a few bugs in 0.2-Alpha.


Changes since version 0.2-Alpha
===============================

* New child value access functions added to MDObject, with (optional)
  default values for missing children.
* MDObject is now derived from MDObjectNamedList which contains all
  children, rather than containing a property which lists children
* Added "fudge" code to deal with arrays that are not the last item
  in a "fixed length" pack.
* Fixed bug in reading arrays with > 1 type per entry, they were
  erroneously read in alphabetical order!
* Fixed bug where MDOTypes where added to ChildOrder twice
* Index tables now working, though not very efficient loading


Changes since version 0.1-Alpha
===============================

* Each MDObject stores information about where it came from which can be
  read using functions Location() and Source()
* Code now handles differences in HeaderByteCount between version 10 and 
  version 11a.
* Rational and TimeStamp compounds have their own traits
* Various minor bugs cleaned up
