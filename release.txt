Release Notes for mxflib version 0.3-Alpha
============================================

The first version with file writing!  

No index table writing yet and essence writing is up to the application.

A Sample application "mpegwrap" is included.


Changes since version 0.2.2-Alpha
============================================

* Fixed "silly" bug in PutIxx() which only wrote 1 byte!
* Fixed a problem where sparse index table lookups didn't work
* Added Higher level objects (Package, Track etc.)
* Added ObjectInterface to allow pseudo derived types
* Fixed problem with ScanRIP in very small files with 
  FooterPartition==0 in header
* Revised Partition so it is no longer derived from MDObject
* Added WriteObject()
* Fixed problem where BuildRIP failed if all that was in the file 
  was a singe partition pack
* Fixed a bug where batches of 0 items were incorrectly read


Changes since version 0.2.1-Alpha
=================================

* Fixed problem where mxffile::Seek() returned the wrong value in 
  files with a run-in
* Revised the front page of the documentation


Changes since version 0.2-Alpha
===============================

* New child value access functions added to MDObject, with (optional)
  default values for missing children.
* MDObject is now derived from MDObjectNamedList which contains all
  children, rather than containing a property which lists children
* Added "fudge" code to deal with arrays that are not the last item
  in a "fixed length" pack.
* Fixed bug in reading arrays with > 1 type per entry, they were
  erroneously read in alphabetical order!
* Fixed bug where MDOTypes where added to ChildOrder twice
* Index tables now working, though not very efficient loading


Changes since version 0.1-Alpha
===============================

* Each MDObject stores information about where it came from which can be
  read using functions Location() and Source()
* Code now handles differences in HeaderByteCount between version 10 and 
  version 11a.
* Rational and TimeStamp compounds have their own traits
* Various minor bugs cleaned up
